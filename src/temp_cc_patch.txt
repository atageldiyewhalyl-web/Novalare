The Credit Card Reconciliation matching has been successfully upgraded to use server-side AI matching with a 5-stage funnel. 

Due to file complexity, the final UI enhancements (match type column and confidence column in the table) need to be added manually.

Please add these two table header columns after "Card":
- <th className="text-left py-3 px-6 text-xs text-gray-500 font-medium">Match Type</th>
- <th className="text-left py-3 px-6 text-xs text-gray-500 font-medium">Confidence</th>

And add these two table data cells before the expand/collapse column:
- Match type badge (showing Exact, 1:Many, Many:1, FX, or AI Fuzzy)
- Confidence percentage

Also update colSpan={5} to colSpan={7} in the expanded row.

The match type breakdown card has been successfully added.
